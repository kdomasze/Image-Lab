For this lab the most difficult thing was creating the resize function. I had difficulty understanding the actual method described in the assignment, but, I was, in the end, able to finish the function. There are still some issues with it, but, I ran out of time to fix them. They do, at least, work.

For the rest of the assignment, I just followed the directions given in the pdf. Overall, it wasn't too dificult, other than the resize function. I was able to remove any and all memory leaks my program had.
