# README #

Photo labs done solo for the EECS 22 class at UCI. Excluding the first homework assignment (marked `hw1`), each one built on each other, adding additional functionality before proceeding to video manipulation.

Excluding the final project missing the text file, each project contains a .script file that demonstrates the programs output and a text file with information lightly detailing difficulties and the process I went through to create the programs. 

The programs were initially compiled and ran on `CentOS 6.9 (Final)` using `gcc 4.4.7 2013313`.
